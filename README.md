# **Kickstarting with Excel - Analysis by Crystina Dang**

## **Overview of Project**

### Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis is to prove and inform how Excel's versatile tools are used to easily organize and visualize data using formulas and various charts. By considering which cross references would best represent the information needed, the data can be distilled into a digestable form to meet conclusions made.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  According to the data, May is the most successful month to launch a campaign. December has a considerably lower total of launches with successful and failed campaign averaging about the same amount, which in comparison to the rest of the year, proves it is a very unsuccessful time to launch. In conclusion, the distribution of data is skewed slightly right towards the beginning of the year for both successful and failed campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  When the goal amount is considered, the data proves that the lower the amount, the less likely it is to be canceled or to fail. The percentage of campaigns that are successful as the goal amount increases shows a trend of steady decline. What is not considered is the currency type and country, which could greatly skew the goal amount.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  A few challenges I encountered was representing the information in the Outcomes Based on Goals in percentages, sorting the list that is not Ascending or Descending when the titles are not alphabetically or numerically in order, and Grouping dates by months.

## Results

*- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?*
May is the most successful month and December is the least successful month.
*- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?*
A lower goal amount will likely lead to a higher success rate.
*- What are some limitations of this dataset?*
Limitations to this dataset are the reasons for failure that may include length of campaign or reason for cancelation.
*- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?*
The length of the campaign in reference to rate of success, failure, and cancelation could provide some insight.

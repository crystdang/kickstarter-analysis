## **Overview of Project**

### Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis is to prove and inform how Excel's versatile tools are used to easily organize and visualize data using formulas and various charts. By considering which cross references would best represent the information needed, the data can be distilled into a digestable form to meet conclusions made.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
A few challenges I encountered was representing the information in the Outcomes Based on Goals in percentages, sorting the list that is not Ascending or Descending, and

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
